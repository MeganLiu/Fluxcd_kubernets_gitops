Headlamp: The Kubernetes Web UI & Management Dashboard
Primary Function: Headlamp is a web-based Kubernetes UI and dashboard. It's designed to provide a user-friendly visual interface for interacting with and managing your Kubernetes resources directly.


What it does:

Resource Management: Allows you to browse, inspect, and sometimes edit (with caution) Kubernetes API objects like Pods, Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, PVCs, Nodes, Namespaces, etc.

Logs and Events: Provides easy access to container logs and Kubernetes events, which are crucial for debugging.

Current State: Shows you the "current state" of your cluster and its resources (e.g., "Is this Pod running?", "What is the YAML for this Deployment?", "What are the current events on this Node?").

Developer Experience: Aims to provide a simpler interface for developers and operators to understand and interact with the cluster without relying solely on kubectl commands.

Focus: It's focused on "what is currently deployed" and "how are my Kubernetes objects configured and behaving right now."

Why They Are Complementary
Grafana tells you if there's a problem (metrics) and what the trend is. For example, Grafana might show you that your application's CPU usage is spiking or that a certain Pod is constantly restarting.

Headlamp helps you investigate the problem and manage the underlying resources. Once Grafana alerts you to an issue, you can use Headlamp to quickly find the problematic Pod, view its logs, check its YAML configuration, or shell into the container to diagnose further.

In short:

Grafana = Observability (Metrics, Trends, Performance)

Headlamp = Operational Management & Resource Inspection (Current State, Configuration, Logs)

So, while you don't have to install Headlamp if you have Grafana, installing both provides a much more complete and user-friendly toolkit for managing, monitoring, and troubleshooting your Kubernetes cluster. Many organizations use both to leverage the strengths of each tool.
